# SHopping

The project is a full stack web application for a grocery delivery system. The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The backend of the application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The database used in the project is SQLite, a lightweight relational database management system.

The application allows users to browse and purchase groceries online, and have them delivered to their doorstep. The frontend of the application includes a user interface for browsing products, adding them to a cart, and checking out. The backend of the application includes an API for retrieving product information and processing orders. The database is used to store product information and order data.

The project includes several folders, each with a specific purpose. The frontend folder contains all the code for the frontend of the application, including the user interface components and the JavaScript code that interacts with the backend API. The backend folder contains all the code for the backend of the application, including the Flask app and the API routes. The database folder contains the SQL schema and seed data for the SQLite database. The tests folder contains all the unit tests for the application.

Overall, the project is a good example of a full stack web application, and demonstrates how to build a simple e-commerce platform using React and Flask.
